I'm an aspiring **Network Engineer** from the Czech Republic.
I have **completed CCNA I – Introduction to Networks** at Czech Technical University in Prague and I actively build networking projects in **GNS3**.

I enjoy designing networks and understanding how routing, security, and monitoring work together in real-world scenarios.
