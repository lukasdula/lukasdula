# Hi, I'm Lukas 👨‍💻

I'm an aspiring **Network Engineer** from Czechia, now studying **CCNA I -> Introduction to Networks** at ČVUT.  
I enjoy designing and building networks, and I like how each lab helps me understand networking more deeply.

## 🎯 Goals
- Finish all parts of the **CCNA certification**.    
- Improve my skills in **network monitoring with Wireshark**.
- Build more advanced labs and projects in **Packet Tracer** and **GNS3**.    
- Get real-world skills for a future role as a **Junior Network Engineer**.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox, QEMU.
- **Lab tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3.    
- **Monitoring:** Wireshark, basic traffic analysis.
- **Operating systems:** Windows 11 Pro, Xubuntu (KDE Plasma).  
- **Documentation:** Structured notes in English and Czech (Obsidian -> Visual Studio Code - > GitHub).   
- **Networking:** All main functions covered in CCNA I – switching, routing, addressing, NAT, DHCP, ACLs...

## 📂 Projects & Labs
I’m building a portfolio of projects in **Packet Tracer** and **GNS3**.
These projects show my path from simple labs to more complex networks.
